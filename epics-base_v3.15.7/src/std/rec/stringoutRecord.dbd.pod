=title String Output Record (stringout)

The stringout record is used to write an arbitrary ASCII string of up to 40
characters to other records or software variables.

=recordtype stringout

=cut

include "menuIvoa.dbd"

menu(stringoutPOST) {
	choice(stringoutPOST_OnChange,"On Change")
	choice(stringoutPOST_Always,"Always")
}
recordtype(stringout) {
	include "dbCommon.dbd"
	field(VAL,DBF_STRING) {
		prompt("Current Value")
		promptgroup("50 - Output")
		asl(ASL0)
		pp(TRUE)
		size(40)
	}

=head2 Parameter Fields

The record-specific fields are described below, grouped by functionality.

=head3 Scan Parameters

The string output record has the standard fields for specifying under what
circumstances it will be processed. These fields are listed in
L<Scan Fields>.
In addition, L<Scanning Specification>
explains how these fields are used.

=head3 Desired Output Parameters

The string output record must specify from where it gets its desired output
string. The first field that determines where the desired output originates is
the output mode select (OSML) field, which can have two possible value: C<<<
closed_loop >>> or C<<< supervisory >>>. If C<<< supervisory >>> is specified,
DOL is ignored, the current value of VAL is written, and the VAL can be changed
externally via dbPuts at run-time. If C<<< closed_loop >>> is specified, the VAL
field's value is obtained from the address specified in the desired output
location field (DOL) which can be either a database link or a channel access
link.

DOL can also be a constant in addition to a link, in which case VAL is
initialized to the constant value. However, your string constant may be
interpreted as a CA link name, so if you want to initialize your string output
record, it's best to use the VAL field. Note that if DOL is a constant, OMSL
cannot be C<<< closed_loop. >>> See
L<Address Specification>
for information on specifying links.

=fields VAL, DOL, OMSL

=cut

	field(DOL,DBF_INLINK) {
		prompt("Desired Output Loc")
		promptgroup("40 - Input")
		interest(1)
	}
	field(OMSL,DBF_MENU) {
		prompt("Output Mode Select")
		promptgroup("50 - Output")
		interest(1)
		menu(menuOmsl)
	}

=head3 Write Parameters

The output link specified in the OUT field specifies where the string output
record is to write its string. The link can be a database or channel access
link. If the OUT field is a constant, no output will be written. See L<Address
Specification> for information on specifying links.

In addition, the appropriate device support module must be entered into the DTYP
field.

=fields OUT, DTYP

=cut

	field(OUT,DBF_OUTLINK) {
		prompt("Output Specification")
		promptgroup("50 - Output")
		interest(1)
	}

=head3 Monitor Parameters

These parameters are used to specify when the monitor post should be sent by
C<monitor()> routine. There are two possible choices:

=head4 Menu stringoutPOST

=menu stringoutPOST

APST is used for archiver monitors and MPST is for all other type of monitors.

=fields MPST, APST

=cut

	field(MPST,DBF_MENU) {
		prompt("Post Value Monitors")
		promptgroup("80 - Display")
		interest(1)
		menu(stringoutPOST)
	}
	field(APST,DBF_MENU) {
		prompt("Post Archive Monitors")
		promptgroup("80 - Display")
		interest(1)
		menu(stringoutPOST)
	}

=head3 Operator Display Parameters

These parameters are used to present meaningful data to the operator. These
fields are used to display the value and other parameters of the string output
either textually or graphically.

See L<Fields Common to All Record Types>
for more on the record name (NAME) and description (DESC) fields.

=fields NAME, DESC

=head3 Alarm Parameters

The possible alarm conditions for the string output record are the SCAN, READ,
and INVALID alarms. The severity of the first two is always MAJOR and not
configurable.

The IVOA field specifies an action to take when the INVALID alarm is triggered.
There are three possible actions:

=head4 Menu menuIvoa

=menu menuIvoa

When C<<< Set output to IVOV >>>, the value contained in the IVOV field is
written to the output link during an alarm condition. See
L<Invalid Alarm Output Action>
for more information on the IVOA and IVOV fields.
L<Alarm Fields>
lists other fields related to a alarms that are common to all record types.

=fields IVOA, IVOV

=cut

	field(IVOA,DBF_MENU) {
		prompt("INVALID output action")
		promptgroup("50 - Output")
		interest(2)
		menu(menuIvoa)
	}
	field(IVOV,DBF_STRING) {
		prompt("INVALID output value")
		promptgroup("50 - Output")
		interest(2)
		size(40)
	}

=head3 Run-time and Simulation Mode Parameters

The old value field (OVAL) of the string input is used to implement value change
monitors for VAL. If VAL is not equal to OVAL, then monitors are triggered.

=fields OVAL

The following fields are used to operate the string output in the simulation
mode. See
L<Simulation Mode>
for more information on these fields.

=fields SIOL, SIML, SIMM, SIMS

=cut

	field(OVAL,DBF_STRING) {
		prompt("Previous Value")
		special(SPC_NOMOD)
		interest(3)
		size(40)
	}

	field(SIOL,DBF_OUTLINK) {
		prompt("Sim Output Specifctn")
		promptgroup("90 - Simulate")
		interest(1)
	}
	field(SIML,DBF_INLINK) {
		prompt("Sim Mode Location")
		promptgroup("90 - Simulate")
		interest(1)
	}
	field(SIMM,DBF_MENU) {
		prompt("Simulation Mode")
		interest(1)
		menu(menuYesNo)
	}
	field(SIMS,DBF_MENU) {
		prompt("Sim mode Alarm Svrty")
		promptgroup("90 - Simulate")
		interest(2)
		menu(menuAlarmSevr)
	}

=head2 Record Support

=head3 Record Support Routines

=head4 init_record

  long (*init_record)(struct dbCommon *precord, int pass)

This routine initializes SIMM if SIML is a constant or creates a channel access
link if SIML is PV_LINK. If SIOL is PV_LINK a channel access link is created.

This routine next checks to see that device support is available. The routine
next checks to see if the device support write routine is defined. If either
device support or the device support write routine does not exist, an error
message is issued and processing is terminated.

If DOL is a constant, then the type double constant, if non-zero, is converted
to a string and stored into VAL and UDF is set to FALSE. If DOL type is a
PV_LINK then dbCaAddInlink is called to create a channel access link.

If device support includes C<init_record()>, it is called.

=head4 process

  long (*process)(struct dbCommon *precord)

See L<Record Processing>.

=head3 Record Processing

Routine process implements the following algorithm:

=over

=item 1.

Check to see that the appropriate device support module exists. If it doesn't,
an error message is issued and processing is terminated with the PACT field
still set to TRUE. This ensures that processes will no longer be called for this
record. Thus error storms will not occur.

=item 2.

If PACT is FALSE and OMSL is CLOSED_LOOP, recGblGetLinkValue is called to read
the current value of VAL. See L<Soft Output>.
If the return status of recGblGetLinkValue is zero then UDF is set to FALSE.

=item 3.

Check severity and write the new value. See
L<Simulation Mode>
and L<Invalid Alarm Output Action>
for details on how the simulation mode and the INVALID alarm conditions affect output.

=item 4.

If PACT has been changed to TRUE, the device support write output routine has
started but has not completed writing the new value. In this case, the
processing routine merely returns, leaving PACT TRUE.

=item 5.

Check to see if monitors should be invoked.

=over

=item *

Alarm monitors are invoked if the alarm status or severity has changed.

=item *

Archive and value change monitors are invoked if OVAL is not equal to VAL.

=item *

NSEV and NSTA are reset to 0.

=back

=item 6.

Scan forward link if necessary, set PACT FALSE, and return.

=head2 Device Support

=head3 Fields Of Interest To Device Support

Each stringout output record must have an associated set of device support
routines. The primary responsibility of the device support routines is to write
a new value whenever write_stringout is called. The device support routines are
primarily interested in the following fields:

=fields PACT, DPVT, NSEV, NSTA, VAL, OUT

=head3 Device Support Routines (devSoSoft.c)

=head4 write_stringout

  long write_stringout(stringoutRecord *prec)

This routine must output a new value. It returns the following values:

=over

=item * 0: Success.

=item * Other: Error.

=back

=head3 Device Support for Soft Records

The C<<< Soft Channel >>> device support module writes the current value of VAL.

If the OUT link type is PV_LINK, then dbCaAddInlink is called by
C<init_record()>.

write_so calls recGblPutLinkValue to write the current value of VAL. See
L<Soft Output>.
