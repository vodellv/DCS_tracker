Repo for sandboxing ideas on how to manage Mu2e DCS development efforts. This might be useful and make sense someday.

For now, to make use of this you will need to `cd` into `epics-base_v3.15.7` directory and run `make`. Afterwards, `cd`
back up to `dcs_template` and run `source setup_dcs.sh`. You should now have a working installation of EPICS, meaning
you can run `caget`, `caput`, `camonitor` etc.

The hope is that a similar approach can be made for standardizing making `db` files for EPICS IOCs, piecemeal checkouts
of Mu2e-supported EPICS Device Drivers (SNMP, IPMI, I2C, etc). This is all very much a work-in-progress
